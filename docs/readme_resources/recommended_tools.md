While there are lots of options for your development environment, it is recommended that you use one listed below.

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   w/ [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) installed.
2. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
3. [Atom](https://atom.io/)

If using Visual Studio code it is also recommended that you use the settings.json located in .vscode/settings.json. If
not using VSCode it is recommended mimic some settings (the linting/formatting will help
greatly!)

listed below.

1. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
