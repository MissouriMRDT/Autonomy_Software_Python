def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    """
    Calculate the bearing and great circle distance between two points
    on the earth (specified in decimal degrees) using
    the haversine formula. Assumes a perfectly spherical earth,
    so take the results with a grain of salt.

    Returns
    -------
        bearing : float
            bearing to target as degrees clockwise from due north
        distance : float (kilometers)
            distance to target in kilometers
