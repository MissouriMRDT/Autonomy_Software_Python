def calculate_next_coordinate(start, former_goal):
    """
    Performs a calculation for the next target gps on a spiral search pattern. Uses the
    archimedean spiral formula r (radius) = a (constant) θ (angle) to generate a series
    of GPS coordiantes in a spiral pattern, suitable for traversing terrain and sweeping
    the area with camera

    Parameters:
    -----------
        start (gps coordinate) - the coordinate at which Search Pattern was initated
        former goal (gps coordinate) - the previous gps coordinate in the search pattern

    Returns:
    --------
        gps coordinate - the next point to travers to in the spiral
